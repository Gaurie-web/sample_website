                    <h2>Applications</h2>
                    <h3>Computer Science with Business Applications</h3>
                    <p>The Computer Science with Business Applications major is designed to provide students with a broad background in science and humanities and to provide an understanding of fundamental principles of computing and modern computing technology.</p>
                    <h3>Computer Science with Biology</h3>
                    <p>Computational biology, which is also known as bioinformatics, is the combined application of math, statistics and computer science to solve biology-based problems. Computational biology leverages quantitative tools such as machine learning, statistical physics, algorithm design and frequency statistics.</p>
                    <h3>Computer Science with Education</h3>
                    <p>Computer science (CS) is an important element in strengthening existing education models and preparing students for the future. Building on previous work, we define CS as the study of both computer hardware and software design including theoretical algorithms, artificial intelligence, and programming. CS education can also include elements of computational thinking: a problem-solving approach that involves decomposition, use of algorithms, abstraction, and automation </p>
                    <h3>Computer Science with Arts</h3>
                    <p>Computers are, though, making some types of art more accessible. Many artists now learn to code; computer scientists develop algorithms with aesthetics as the goal. Projects such as Deep Dream, a program that uses neural networks to produce new visuals, let anyone use AI approaches to generate, ostensibly, art.</p>
                    <h3>Computer Science with Mathematics</h3>
                    <p>Algebra is used in computer science in the development of algorithms and software for working with mathematical objects. It is also used to design formulas that are used in numerical programs and for complete scientific computations.</p>
