                 <h2>What is Computer Science?</h2>
                 <p>Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.</p>
            </div>
            <section id = "applications">
            <div class = "applications_class">
                <h2>Applications</h2>
                <h3>Computer Science with Business Applications</h3>
                <p>The Computer Science with Business Applications major is designed to provide students with a broad background in science and humanities and to provide an understanding of fundamental principles of computing and modern computing technology.</p>
                <h3>Computer Science with Biology</h3>
                <p>Computational biology, which is also known as bioinformatics, is the combined application of math, statistics and computer science to solve biology-based problems. Computational biology leverages quantitative tools such as machine learning, statistical physics, algorithm design and frequency statistics.</p>
                <h3>Computer Science with Education</h3>
                <p>Computer science (CS) is an important element in strengthening existing education models and preparing students for the future. Building on previous work, we define CS as the study of both computer hardware and software design including theoretical algorithms, artificial intelligence, and programming. CS education can also include elements of computational thinking: a problem-solving approach that involves decomposition, use of algorithms, abstraction, and automation </p>
                <h3>Computer Science with Arts</h3>
                <p>Computers are, though, making some types of art more accessible. Many artists now learn to code; computer scientists develop algorithms with aesthetics as the goal. Projects such as Deep Dream, a program that uses neural networks to produce new visuals, let anyone use AI approaches to generate, ostensibly, art.</p>
                <h3>Computer Science with Mathematics</h3>
                <p>Algebra is used in computer science in the development of algorithms and software for working with mathematical objects. It is also used to design formulas that are used in numerical programs and for complete scientific computations.</p>

                <h2>Types</h2>
                <h3>Algorithms and complexity</h3>
                <p>An algorithm is a specific procedure for solving a well-defined computational problem. The development and analysis of algorithms is fundamental to all aspects of computer science: artificial intelligence, databases, graphics, networking, operating systems, security, and so on. Algorithm development is more than just programming. It requires an understanding of the alternatives available for solving a computational problem, including the hardware, networking, programming language, and performance constraints that accompany any particular solution. It also requires understanding what it means for an algorithm to be “correct” in the sense that it fully and efficiently solves the problem at hand.</p>
                <h3>Architecture and organization</h3>
                <p>Computer architecture deals with the design of computers, data storage devices, and networking components that store and run programs, transmit data, and drive interactions between computers, across networks, and with users. Computer architects use parallelism and various strategies for memory organization to design computing systems with very high performance. Computer architecture requires strong communication between computer scientists and computer engineers, since they both focus fundamentally on hardware design.</p>
                <h3>Graphics and visual computing</h3>
                <p>Graphics and visual computing is the field that deals with the display and control of images on a computer screen. This field encompasses the efficient implementation of four interrelated computational tasks: rendering, modeling, animation, and visualization. Graphics techniques incorporate principles of linear algebra, numerical integration, computational geometry, special-purpose hardware, file formats, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to accomplish these complex tasks.</p>
                <h3>Human-computer interaction</h3>
                <p>Human-computer interaction (HCI) is concerned with designing effective interaction between users and computers and the construction of interfaces that support this interaction. HCI occurs at an interface that includes both software and hardware. User interface design impacts the life cycle of software, so it should occur early in the design process. Because user interfaces must accommodate a variety of user styles and capabilities, HCI research draws on several disciplines including psychology, sociology, anthropology, and engineering. In the 1960s, user interfaces consisted of computer consoles that allowed an operator directly to type commands that could be executed immediately or at some future time. With the advent of more user-friendly personal computers in the 1980s, user interfaces became more sophisticated, so that the user could “point and click” to send a command to the operating system.</p>
                <h3>Networking and communication</h3>
                <p>The field of networking and communication includes the analysis, design, implementation, and use of local, wide-area, and mobile networks that link computers together. The Internet itself is a network that makes it feasible for nearly all computers in the world to communicate.

                A computer network links computers together via a combination of infrared light signals, radio wave transmissions, telephone lines, television cables, and satellite links. The challenge for computer scientists has been to develop protocols (standardized rules for the format and exchange of messages) that allow processes running on host computers to interpret the signals they receive and to engage in meaningful “conversations” in order to accomplish tasks on behalf of users. Network protocols also include flow control, which keeps a data sender from swamping a receiver with messages that it has no time to process or space to store, and error control, which involves transmission error detection and automatic resending of messages to correct such errors. (For some of the technical details of error detection and correction, see information theory.)</p>
